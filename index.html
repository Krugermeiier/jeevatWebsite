        <p>Hi, my name is Jeevat, but people mostly know me by the username 'Krugermeiier'. I'm 16 and from Northeastern United States. <br> 
            I make random shit sometimes, whether it's programs made mostly in Python or in JavaScript or other stuff like videos and small art. <br>
            I do also play games, Hitman 3 is probably my favorite.
        </p>
        <p>My username originates from <a href="https://hitman.fandom.com/wiki/Krugermeier_2-2">Hitman World of Assassination's Krugermeier</a>, a subsonic pistol that looks cool and is very useful. <br>
            I just thought it sounded cool and rolled with it. <br>
            The reason there is an extra i in my name is because the name 'Krugermeier' was taken like everywhere, lmao.
